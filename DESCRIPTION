Title: Estimation of local false discovery rate
Author: Stefanie Scheid <stefanie.scheid@gmx.de>
Description: In a typical microarray setting with gene expression data
        observed under two conditions, the local false discovery rate
        describes the probability that a gene is not differentially
        expressed between the two conditions given its corrresponding
        observed score or p-value level. The resulting curve of
        p-values versus local false discovery rate offers an insight
        into the twilight zone between clear differential and clear
        non-differential gene expression. Package TWILIGHT contains
        two main functions: Function twilight.pval performs a
        two-condition test on differences in means for a given input
        matrix or expression set and computes permutation based
        p-values. Function twilight performs a stochastic downhill
        search to estimate local false discovery rates and effect size
        distributions.
